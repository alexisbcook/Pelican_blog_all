Title: About Me

Hello!  My name is Alexis Cook.

I am an expat living in beautiful [Guanajuato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanajuato_City), Mexico. 

Until recently, I was a graduate student in computer science at Brown University.  You can read more about my academic and career background through my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexis-cook-a6127753) page.

In addition to machine learning and data science, I also enjoy [drawing](https://alexisbcook.github.io/pages/artwork.html), reading short fiction, making bread, and hiking with my rescue dog [Sopa](https://www.instagram.com/p/BJRUrzjgJ7k/?taken-by=alexis_nubet).
