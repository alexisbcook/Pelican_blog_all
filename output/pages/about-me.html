            <p>Hello!  My name is Alexis Cook.</p>
<p>I am an expat living in beautiful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanajuato_City">Guanajuato</a>, Mexico. </p>
<p>Until recently, I was a graduate student in computer science at Brown University.  I have also studied (applied) mathematics for a very long time.  You can read more about my academic and career background through my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexis-cook-a6127753">LinkedIn</a> page.</p>
<p>I have strong interests in machine learning and computer vision.  I intend to use this blog primarily to refresh my memory of topics in these areas.  I will occassionaly post about new topics. </p>
<p>In my experience, the best way to learn is through adopting an approach that favors <em>diversity</em> - through conversations with as many people as possible, and by comparing multiple sources.  Wikipedia is a lifetime favorite, along with the personal blogs that I trip over through Google searches.  I hope to provide a very small contribution to this literature.</p>
<p>Since 2008, I have been talking to myself, out loud, and <em>generally not in public</em>, about academic concepts in order to deepen my knowledge.  It's weird, I'm sure, but <a href="http://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2016/03/explaining-yourself.aspx">it works</a>!  I think it's important to tell the full story, and to explain the intuition and motivation behind concepts, especially those of a mathematical nature.  Where appropriate, I try to do just that.  </p>
<p>To that end, the intended audience of this blog is currently: <strong><em>Me</em></strong>.  That might change in the future, but for now, these are my personal notes that I hope you are able to find useful!  I love Python, IPython notebooks, and visualizations.  I am a visual learner, and hopefully, you are, too! </p>
<p>In addition to machine learning and data science, I also enjoy <a href="https://alexisbcook.github.io/pages/artwork.html">drawing</a>, reading short fiction, making bread, and hiking with my rescue dog <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BJRUrzjgJ7k/?taken-by=alexis_nubet">Sopa</a>.  </p>
